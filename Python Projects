# Project 1: This project is meant to calculate the three different types if tips the user gits.

#Accept user input

meal_cost = input("Enter the cost of the meal: $")
meal_cost = float(meal_cost)

print("Cost of the meal: $", meal_cost)
 #The first tip calculation
exc_per = .20
exc_ser_tip = meal_cost * exc_per

fir_total =exc_ser_tip + meal_cost

print("Excellent Service tip: $", exc_ser_tip,"Total: $", fir_total)

avg_per = .15
avg_ser_tip = meal_cost * avg_per
#the second tip calculation
sec_total = avg_ser_tip + meal_cost

print("Average service tip: $", avg_ser_tip, "Total: $", sec_total)
#The third tip calculation
poor_per = .10
poor_ser_tip = meal_cost * poor_per

thrd_total = poor_ser_tip + meal_cost

print("Poor service tip: $", poor_ser_tip, "Total: $", thrd_total)

# what I learned more from this prject was mor how to be patience with solving the issue hand. 
#The main difficultly was that I let my fustratiion get to me therefore I couldn't come up with the proper soluiton
